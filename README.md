# DeliverySimulation

This project is a simulation of package deliveries across several towns. I was provided with CSV files that held
all of the data needed for a simulation, including delivery location information, package information and constraints 
(such as specific deadlines), and a distance matrix. From there, I designed and developed an OOP simulation that runs as a CLI. 
The CLI presents options to the user to enable them to observe the outcomes of the run.

To optimize the deliveries (i.e., reduce the overall miles driven), I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. 
This optimization reduced the traveled miles by 50%. 

This was a very enjoyable project to work on. I really enjoyed designing the system and all of the 
classes and how they would interact logically while adhering to object-oriented design principles. It was also satisfying to solve inefficiencies in the system by researching
an algorithm, configuring and implementing it,
and deriving significant performance improvements.
